    <h2>Description</h2>
<p>Tsuivan is a Mongolian noodle dish that is usually prepared with mutton and various vegetables. The noodles are traditionally made by hand and they're steamed or cooked together with diced meat and vegetables. People sometimes replace mutton with beef, camel, and even horse meat, while the vegetables used in the dish typically include onions, peppers, cabbage, carrots, or potatoes.

    Tsuivan is enjoyed throughout the country, and it is best served freshly prepared and sprinkled with scallions.</p>
